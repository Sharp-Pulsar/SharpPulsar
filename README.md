# SharpPulsar
SharpPulsar is Apache Pulsar client built with Akka.net, inspired from the Pulsar java client. 

The goal is to match java client features so that .Net developers lack nothing!

The library is a work in progress!

## Note
JsonSchema is basically AvroSchema underneath!

Supported pulsar cluster versions: 2.5+
